# Doubly linked lists

Suppose we have a doubly-linked list with the following elements and their indices:

```
Index: 0      1      2      3
List: [A] <-> [B] <-> [C] <-> [D]
```

Let's say you want to insert an item X at index 2, following the method in the provided code. Here's how the process would look:

1. Check if the index is out of bounds. In this case, it's not, so we proceed.
2. Check if the index is equal to the length of the list. In this case, it's not, so we proceed.
3. Check if the index is 0. In this case, it's not, so we proceed.
4. Increment the list length by 1.
5. Initialize curr with the list's head.
6. Iterate through the list until the desired index is reached (index 2 in this example).
7. Create the new node X with the value item.
8. Update the pointers as follows:

- Set X.next to point to C.
- Set X.prev to point to B.
- Set C.prev to point to X.

9. Update the next property of the previous node (node B):

- Set B.next to point to X.

After these steps, the list would look like this:

```
Index: 0      1      2      3      4
List: [A] <-> [B] <-> [X] <-> [C] <-> [D]
```

As you can see, the new item X is inserted at the specified index (2) while preserving the double links between the nodes.

## Implementation

Let's implement this algorithm.

```TS

export default class DoublyLinkedList<T> {
  public length: number;
  private head?: Node<T>;
  private tail?: Node<T>;

  constructor() {
    this.length = 0;
    this.head = undefined;
    this.tail = undefined;
  }

  prepend(item: T): void {
    // This line creates a new Node object with a value property set to the item argument passed to the method. The Node<T> type hint implies that this is a TypeScript implementation and the list is a generic list, capable of handling elements of type T.
    const node = { value: item } as Node<T>;

    // This increments the list's length by 1, as a new element is being added
    this.length++;

    //  this code checks if the list is empty, and if so, it initializes the list with the first element, making both the head and tail pointers point to the same node.
    if (!this.head) {
      this.head = this.tail = node;
    }

    // This line updates the next property of the new node to point to the current head of the list
    node.next = this.head;

    // This line updates the prev property of the current head to point back to the new node, establishing the double link between the new node and the old head.
    this.head.prev = node;

    //  Finally, this line updates the head pointer of the list to point to the new node, making it the new head of the list.
    this.head = node;
  }

  insertAt(item: T, idx: numner): void {
    // The following lines handle the case when the given index idx is out of bounds.
    if (idx > this.length) {
      // If the index is greater than the list's length, an error is thrown with the message 'oh no'
      throw new Error('oh no');

    } else if (idx === this.length) {
      // In this case, the method calls this.append(item) to add the item to the end of the list and then immediately returns.
      this.append(item);
      return;
    } else if (idx === 0) {
      // In this case, the method calls this.prepend(item) to add the item to the front of the list and then immediately returns.
      this.prepend(item);
      return;
    }

    // his increments the list's length by 1, as a new element is being inserted.
    this.length++;

    const curr = this.getAt(idx) as Node<T>;

    // This creates a new Node object with a value property set to the item argument passed to the method.
    const node = { value: item } as Node<T>

    // The following lines create the double links between the new node and its neighbors:

    node.next = curr; //  set the next property of the new node to point to the current node
    node.prev = curr.prev; // the prev property of the new node to point to the previous node
    curr.prev = node; // the prev property of the current node to point to the new node


    // Finally, the following lines update the next property of the previous node if it exists
    if (node.prev) {
      node.prev.next = curr;
    }
  }

  append(item: T): void {
    //  Increment the length of the list
    this.length++;

    const node = { value: item } as Node<T>
    if (!this.tail) {
      // If the list is empty, set both the head and tail to the new node
      this.head = this.tail = node;
      return;
    }

     // If the list is not empty, update the pointers. Set the tail's next property to the new node
    this.tail.next = node;

     // Set the new node's prev property to the current tail
    node.prev = this.tail;

    // Update the tail to the new node
    this.tail =  node;

  }

  remove(item: T): T | undefined {
    // Initialize a variable curr with the list's head as the starting point for traversing the list
    let curr = this.head;

    // Iterate through the list until the specified item is found or the end of the list is reached
    for (let i = 0; curr && i < this.length; i++) {
      if (curr.value === item) {
        break;
      }
      curr = curr.next;
    }

    // If curr is null or undefined, the specified item was not found in the list. In this case, the method returns undefined
    if (!curr) {
      return undefined;
    }

    // If curr is the head of the list, update the head pointer
    if (curr === this.head) {
      this.head = curr.next;
    }

    // If curr is the tail of the list, update the tail pointer:
    if (curr === this.tail) {
      this.tail = curr.prev;
    }

    return this.removeNode(curr);
  }

  get(idx: number): T | undefined {
    return this.getAt(idx)?.value;
  }

  removeAt(idx: number): T | undefined {
    const node = this.getAt(idx);

    if (!node) {
      return undefined;
    }

    return this.removeNode(node);
  }

  private removeNode(node: Node<T>): T | undefined {
    // Decrement the list's length by 1, as an element is being removed
    this.length--;

    // If the list becomes empty after removing the element, update the head and tail pointers to undefined, and return the value of the removed element
    if (this.length === 0) {
      const out = this,head?.value;
      this.head = this.tail = undefined;
      return out;
    }

    // Update the prev pointer of the next node, if it exists
    if (node.prev) {
      node.prev = node.next;
      // curr.prev.next = curr.next; ?
    }

    // Update the next pointer
    if (node.next) {
      node.next = node.prev;
      // curr.next.prev = curr.prev; ?
    }

     // break current links
    node.prev = node.next = undefined;

    // Finally, return the value of the removed node:
    return node.value;
  }

  private getAt(idx: number): Node<T> | undefined {
    let curr = this.head;
    for (let i = 0; curr && i < this.length; i++) {
      curr = curr.next;
    }
    return curr;
  }
}
