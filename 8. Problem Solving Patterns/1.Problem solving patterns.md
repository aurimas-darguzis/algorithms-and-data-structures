# Frequency counters

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings.

Best to start with example. The task is to write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same.

```TS
same([1,2,3], [4,1,9]) // true
same([1,2,3], [1,9]) // false
same([1,2,1], [4,4,1]) // false (must be same frequency)

// the solution that would probably come first to mind:
function same(arr1: number[], arr2: number[]): boolean {

  if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) {
    return false;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    let correctIndex = arr2.indexOf(arr1[i] ** 2)
    if (correctIndex === -1) {
      return false;
    }
    arr2.splice(correctIndex, 1);
  }


  return true;
}
```

This approach gives us O(n^2), because we have 2 loops: the for loop, and indexOf is also a loop. Let's refactor our solution to O(n) and use frequency pattern:

```TS
function same(arr1: number[], arr2: number[]): boolean {
  if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) {
    return false;
  }

  let frequencyCounter1 = {};
  let frequencyCounter2 = {};

  for (let val of arr1) {
    frequencyCounter1[val] = (frequencyCounter1[val] || 0) + 1;
  }

  for (let val of arr2) {
    frequencyCounter2[val] = (frequencyCounter2[val] || 0) + 1;
  }

  for (let key in frequencyCounter1) {
    if (!(key ** 2 in frequencyCounter2)) {
      return false;
    }

    if (frequencyCounter2[key ** 2] !== frequencyCounter1[key]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```
