# Linear search

It's a kind of JavaScript Array method the "indexOf" method. It's a simple search algorithm that searches for a target value within an array. It sequentially checks each element of the array for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.

Let's implement a linear search function that takes an array and a target value as arguments and returns true or false depending on whether the target value is found in the array.

```TS
function linearSearch(haystack: number[], needle: number): boolean {
  for (let i = 0; i < haystack.length; i++) {
    if (haystack[i] === needle) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

```
