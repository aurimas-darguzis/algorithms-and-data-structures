# How to improve in solving problems?

1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns

## Strategies

- understand the problem
- explore concrete examples
- break it down
- solve/simplify
- look back and refactor

### Understand the probelm

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outpus that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

```TS
/*
Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum
 1. implement addition
 2. ints? floats? what about string for large numbers?
 3. int? float? string?
 4. it depends. What do we do if no arguments are passed, or just one argument.
 5. function name, argument names
*/
function sum(n1: number, n2: number): number {
  return n1 + n2;
}
```

### Explore eamples

- coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
- examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
- user stories, unit tests
- start with simple examples
- progress to more comples examples
- explore examples with empty inputs
- explore examples with invalid inputs

```TS
/*
  write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string
*/

chartCount("aaaa"); // {a: 4}
chartCount("hello"); // {h: 1, e: 1, l:2, o: 1}

"my phone numbers is 18234" // what about numbers, empty space..?
"Hello hi" // do we ignore casing?
chartCount("") // what do we do here?

function countCharacters(word: string): number {
  return word.length;
}
```
