#Bubble Sort

In simple form, what this algorithm does, it compares two value that are next to each other. If value a is greater than value b - they swap, if no - they do not. By first iteration we get the highest value at the end of the array. On the next iteration, last element of the array is ignored (because it's already sorted), and we go through the same comparison cycle again.

```JS
// 1st cycle
[1, 3, 7, 4, 2] // [0, ... , N]
// 1 > 3 ? no
// 3 > 7 ? no
// 7 > 4 ? yes
[1, 3, 4, 7, 2]
// 7 > 2 ? yes
[1, 3, 4, 2, | 7] // N - 1
```

Now the last element is the highest, and we no longer apply the check, but the rest of array is not sorted, so here we go again.

```JS
[1, 3, 4, 2, 7]
// 1 > 3 ? no
// 3 > 4 ? no
// 4 > 2 ? yes
[1, 3, 2, | 4, 7] // N - 2
```

By repeating the cycle until there's only one point to check (the first element in the array) - we have it sorted.

## Story time

There's a naughty kid name Gavin and he's a 3rd grader. Gavin always makes trouble in the class and one day the teacher was frustrated, asked everyone to sit down and said: "I want you to add all the numbers from 1 to a 100". To everyones surprise, Gavin did the task in about 10 seconds. Teacher said it can't be true, but this is what Gavin done:

```JS
/* we need to calculate all numbers from 1 to 100.
 If we add those numbers together, we get this:
 1 ... 100 = 101
 2 ... 99 = 101
  ...
 50 ... 56 = 101

 So if we take 101 and time it by 50, you have your answer.

 We can say that 101 is just N + 1
 So then 50 is N/2
*/
```

## Big O

To calculate the Big O of Bubble Sort, we can express it like this:

```JS
n(n+1) / 2 = n^2 // remember, we drop constants
```

That's the running time of this algorithm.

## Algorithm

```TS
function bubbleSort(arr: numer[]): void {
  for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (j = 0, j < arr.length - 1 - i, j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1 ]) {
        const tmp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j + 1] = tmp;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
