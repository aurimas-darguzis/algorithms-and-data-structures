#Recursion
The simplest way to think of recursion is a function that calls itself until the problem is solved. This usually involves what is referred to as a "base case". A base case is the point in which the problem is solved at.

```TS
function foo(n: number): number {
  // Base case
  if (n === 1) {
    return 1;
  }

  // We shall Recurse!
  return n + foo(n -1);
}
```
