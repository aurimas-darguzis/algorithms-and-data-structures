# What is Big O

Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on input. It is not meant to be an exact measurement. It will not tell you now many CPI cycles it takes, instead it is meant to generalize the growth of your algorithm.

## Why do we use it?

Ofter it will help us make decisions about what data structures and algorithms to use. Knowing how they will perform can greatly help create the best possible program out there.

```TS
function sum_char_codes(n: string): number {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {
        sum += n.charCodeAt(i);
    }

    return sum;
}
```

Big O, said diferently - as your input grows, how fast does computation or memory grow?

## Important concepts

1. growth is with respect to the input. Easier way to spot the O, is to look for loops.
2. Constants are dropped. O(2n) is O(n). This is because Big O is meant to describe the upper bound of the algorithm (the growth of the algorithm). The constants eventually becomes irrelevant.

There is practical vs theoretical differences. Just because N is faster then N^2, doesn't mean practically its always faster for smaller inputs. Rememeber, we drop constants. Therefore O(100N) is faster than O(N^2) but practically speaking, you would probably win for some small set of input.

```TS
function sum_char_codes(n: string): number {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {
    const charCode = n.charCodeAt(i);
    // Capital E
    if (charCode === 69) {
      return sum;
    }

    sum += charCode;
  }
}
```

In BigO we often consider the wors case. Especially in interviews - you will be asked to consider the worst case. Therefore any string with E in it will terminate early (unless E is the last item in the list). It's still O(N).

3. Wors case is usually the way we measure.

Some examples

O(N^2)

```TS
function sum_char_codes(n: string): number {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n.length; j++) {
      sum += charCode;
    }
  }

  return sum;
}
```

O(N^3)

```TS
function sum_char_codes(n: string): number {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n.length; j++) {
      for (let k = 0; k < n.length; k++) {
        sum += charCode;
      }
    }
  }

  return sum;
}
```

O(n log n)

- Quicksort (implement later)

O(log n)

- Binary search trees

O(sqrt(n))

- Can you find out the example for this?

Just to reiterate, important concepts:

1. Growth is with respect to the input
2. Constants are dropped
3. Wors case is usually the wya we measure
